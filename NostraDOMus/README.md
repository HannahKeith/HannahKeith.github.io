NostraDOMus is an online oracle that generates a random Nostradomus prediction to accompany the picture, or video, of the day from NASA's APOD API.

The responsive design is achieved using percentage based rules to give the same experience on all screens. The modal was given a scroll function to allow navigation on smartphones.


The API request was problematic and I ended up having to follow specific syntax from an implementation page.  However, I was able to manipulate it to access exactly what I needed and to include the creation of elements that will take images or videos.

The predictions are generated by string interpolation from an array.

Overall the implementation was not terribly problematic as I kept it pretty simple.
